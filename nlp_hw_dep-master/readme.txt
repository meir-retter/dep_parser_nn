Included are the outputs of DepModel for the dev and test cases for parts 1, 2, and 3. For part 3 we chose a configuration of hidden dims=400 and epochs=8, since it gave improvement. Also included are the pickle object file, report.txt, and the python files:


In src:


depModel.py
network.py
net_properties.py
utils2.py

I've also included model1.net, model2.net, and model3.net (the trained models for the three parts). These are in src.

Lastly, I've included


In data:

train.data
vocabs.word
vocabs.pos
vocabs.labels
vocabs.actions


Run the code from src.

Credit goes to the the author of the original code, which Iâ€™ve modified for dependency parsing for this project.
