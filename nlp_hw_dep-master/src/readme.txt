Included are the outputs of DepModel for the dev and test cases for parts 1, 2, and 3. For part 3 we chose a configuration of hidden dims=400 and epochs=8, since it gave improvement. Also included are the pickle object file, report.txt, and the python files:

depModel.py
network.py
net_properties.py
utils2.py

I've also included model1.net, model2.net, and model3.net (the trained models for the three parts).

Lastly, I've included

train.data
vocabs.word
vocabs.pos
vocabs.labels
vocabs.actions
